# Time-series-Forecasting
This is a Course project I have done for the "Bunisess Analytics with R" course during my Undergraduation.
Data is collected from a Government website where daily arrival of the Vegetable(Onion) is available at a Market in Mumbai.
The data appeared to be seasonal and SARIMA model is used to forecast the Onions for the next 2 months
